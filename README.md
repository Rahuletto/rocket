## Why Choose Rocket?

### ‚ö° Blazing Fast
Rocket is built for speed. It‚Äôs like a coding cheetah on a caffeine high. You‚Äôll never have to deal with annoying lags again.

### ü™∂ Light as a Feather
Rocket is tiny compared to most code editors. It‚Äôs designed to be as lightweight as possible, so it won‚Äôt gobble up your system resources. More room for your other important stuff! (Made in Tauri instead of Electron)

### üîß Just the Essentials
Rocket focuses on giving you the basics without the bloat:
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports lots of programming languages.
- **Code Autocompletion**: Helps you write code faster with smart suggestions.
- **Clean Interface**: A minimalist design that keeps you focused on your code.
- **No Learning Curve**: Using Monaco editor under the hood, which is the core of the VSCode.

### üé® Modern and Sleek
Rocket's interface is modern and sleek, making your coding sessions a visual treat. It‚Äôs designed to be easy on the eyes and boost your productivity.

### üåç Made for macOS
Rocket is built to work seamlessly on `macOS` with `Apple Silicon` and `Intel`. No fuss, no muss‚Äîjust smooth coding on your favorite platform.

## The Trade-Offs

We love Rocket, but let's be real. it‚Äôs not perfect. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
- **No Extension Support**: What you see is what you get. No add-ons here due to [limitations on monaco editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/430#issuecomment-306870048).
- **Limited Formatting Options**: Necessary tools only, but they get the job done.
- **Minimal Debugging Tools**: Simple and straightforward, but not fancy.
- **No Integrated Terminal**: You‚Äôll need to use an external terminal for your command-line tasks.

> You don't have to create a new terminal, click on Terminal button to open it from your project directory.

  <summary>‚ÄúRocket‚Äù cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.</summary>
  
  ### Are you seeing a prompt like this?
  

  <img width="275" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Rahuletto/rocket/assets/71836991/6e44e053-f6b0-435d-b5a2-e6e76fbef3c2">

  This is expected as I didn't sign the application using Apple Developer ID
  > In short, Apple wants me to pay a fee to remove that prompt + publish to App Store

  This will prompt only once after installation. We can override this by opening 
  - `System Settings` > `Privacy & Security`
  - Scroll down
