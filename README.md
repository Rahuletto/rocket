## The Trade-Offs

We love Rocket, but let's be real. it’s not perfect. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
- **No Extension Support**: What you see is what you get. No add-ons here due to [limitations on monaco editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/430#issuecomment-306870048).
- **Limited Formatting Options**: Necessary tools only, but they get the job done.
- **Minimal Debugging Tools**: Simple and straightforward, but not fancy.
- **No Integrated Terminal**: You’ll need to use an external terminal for your command-line tasks.

> You don't have to create a new terminal, click on Terminal button to open it from your project directory.
